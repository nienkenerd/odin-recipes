# odin-recipes
This is part of The Odin Project.
I already know HTML/CSS and some JavaScript so I'm just catching up and doing the course without skipping anything!
Hopefully I learn something from this project..

I learnt how to nativigate through vscode. I also learnt how to commit things to the hub, never used it before.
